<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Seam Seal Tapes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2-Layer</li><li>3-Layer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Seam Seal Tapes come in two main types: 2-Layer and 3-Layer. 2-Layer tapes consist of two layers of material, typically a waterproof layer and a protective layer. These tapes are ideal for basic waterproofing needs. On the other hand, 3-Layer tapes have an additional adhesive layer in between the waterproof and protective layers, providing extra durability and strength. This makes them suitable for more heavy-duty applications where a higher level of protection is required. Both types of tapes are commonly used in outdoor gear, such as jackets and tents, to prevent water leakage through seams.</p></p>
