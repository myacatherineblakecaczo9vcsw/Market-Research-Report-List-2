<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Hydraulic Actuator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rack and Pinion</li><li>Vane Type</li><li>Combination type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary hydraulic actuators are classified into three main types based on their design and operation: Rack and Pinion, Vane Type, and Combination type. Rack and Pinion actuators consist of a piston-driven rack that engages with a pinion gear to create rotary motion. Vane Type actuators use vanes sliding in and out of slots in a rotor to produce torque. Combination type actuators combine elements of both rack and pinion and vane type designs to optimize performance for specific applications.</p></p>
