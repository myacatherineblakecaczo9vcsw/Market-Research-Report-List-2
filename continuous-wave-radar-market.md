<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Continuous Wave Radar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unmodulated Continuous Wave</li><li>Modulated Continuous Wave</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Continuous Wave Radar utilizes a continuous wave signal to detect the presence of a target. Unmodulated Continuous Wave radar operates by transmitting a constant frequency signal and measuring any change in frequency that occurs when the signal reflects off a target. On the other hand, Modulated Continuous Wave radar involves the transmission of a frequency-modulated signal. This modulation allows for more precise measurement of target distance and velocity. Both types of Continuous Wave radar have their own unique applications and advantages in various industries.</p></p>
