<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dichroic Color Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Subtractive Dichroic Filters</li><li>Additive Dichroic Filters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dichroic color filters are used in various industries for color manipulation. There are two main types of Dichroic color filters: Subtractive and Additive. Subtractive Dichroic Filters work by absorbing specific colors from white light, allowing only the desired colors to pass through. Additive Dichroic Filters, on the other hand, work by combining different colors of light to create a new color. Both types of filters are crucial in applications such as photography, lighting, and display technology for achieving precise color effects.</p></p>
