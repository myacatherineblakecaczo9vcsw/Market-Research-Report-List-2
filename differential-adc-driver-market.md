<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Differential ADC Driver Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-ended</li><li>Pseudo-differential</li><li>Fully-differential</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single-ended ADC drivers convert the signal from a single-ended source, ground-referenced. Pseudo-differential ADC drivers use a differential amplifier with a single input signal and a reference voltage to emulate a differential input. Fully-differential ADC drivers accept true differential input signals, providing better noise immunity and common-mode rejection compared to single-ended and pseudo-differential drivers. The choice of ADC driver type depends on the application requirements for performance, cost, and complexity.</p></p>
