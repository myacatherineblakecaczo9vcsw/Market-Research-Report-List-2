<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Submarine Communication Cables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unarmoured Submarine Communication Cables</li><li>Armoured Submarine Communication Cables</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Submarine communication cables can be divided into two main types: unarmoured and armoured cables. Unarmoured submarine communication cables are designed for relatively shallow waters and provide basic protection against external factors. On the other hand, armoured submarine communication cables are equipped with additional layers of protection such as steel wires or tapes to withstand harsh underwater conditions and potential damage. Both types of cables play a crucial role in facilitating communications across vast distances underwater.</p></p>
