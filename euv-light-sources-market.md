<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EUV Light Sources Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Energetic Plasma</li><li>Synchrotron Radiation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>EUV light sources are primarily categorized into two types based on their mechanism of generation: energetic plasma sources and synchrotron radiation sources. Energetic plasma sources produce EUV light through the generation of a high-energy plasma that emits the desired wavelength. Synchrotron radiation sources, on the other hand, use synchrotron radiation generated by accelerating charged particles in a circular storage ring. Each type has its own advantages and applications, with energetic plasma sources typically offering higher power levels and synchrotron radiation providing higher brightness and resolution.</p></p>
